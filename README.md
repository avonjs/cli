## Installation

The following commands install Avon CLI for you:

## Configurations

By default, Avon put files generated by Avon cli under `src` directory. to change this path you could configure it by root `package.json` file:

```
{
    ...
    "sourceDir" : "myDir"
}
```

Also, Avon detects the type of package by checking the `tsconfig.json` existence or module type indicated on the package json but you could determine the output file per command:

```
avonjs make:resource Another --output typescript
```

possible output are 'typescript', 'ecmascript' and 'commonjs'
